# List Pagination and Filtering

In this project, I enhanced the usability of a web page that is displaying way too much information all at once. To make it easier for the user to find information and read the page, I added to this project a popular web development technique known as "pagination".

While making these improvements, I adhered to an important development principle known as "progressive enhancement". Which in this case basically just means that you'll add JavaScript to enhance the web page, without making the web page dependent upon the JavaScript that you are adding.

I've written the code to take the default list of 54 students and break it up into separate pages that display only 10 students at a time. Additionally, I programmitcally added buttons to the bottom of the page to allow users to navigate through the list, 10 students at a time.

The solution is dynamic, meaning it will work for any list containing any number of items.
